# Random Forest Prediction Model

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Random Forest** model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
The notebook (`7dd64686-89e5-42d2-94f8-d363a3081e5a.ipynb`) covers the complete workflow of building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model for predictive analysis.

The Random Forest algorithm is an **ensemble learning technique** that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy, control overfitting, and handle both classification and regression problems effectively.
